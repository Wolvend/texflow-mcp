# TeXFlow Long-Form Content Enhancements

## Overview

TeXFlow has been enhanced to support extensive LaTeX projects including books, novels, dissertations, and complex mathematical documents. These enhancements make it ideal for:

- **Long Stories/Novels**: Multi-chapter books with consistent formatting
- **Complex Mathematics**: Extensive equations, theorems, and proofs
- **Academic Writing**: Theses, dissertations, and research papers
- **Technical Documentation**: Large technical manuals with figures and tables

## Key Enhancements

### 1. Optimized Capacity
- **File Size**: 100MB limit - sweet spot for PDFs and large documents
- **Project Size**: 1,000 files per project - handles large multi-chapter works
- **Extended Formats**: Added support for auxiliary LaTeX files (.aux, .toc, etc.)

### 2. Incremental Writing Support

The document tool now supports incremental operations:

```json
{
  "action": "append",
  "path": "chapters/chapter15.tex",
  "content": "\\section{The Plot Thickens}\n\nMore content for your story..."
}
```

**Actions**:
- `create`: Start a new document
- `read`: Read existing content
- `edit`: Replace content
- `append`: Add content to the end (perfect for continuous writing)
- `insert`: Add content at specific positions

### 3. Smart Insertion

Insert content at specific locations:

```json
{
  "action": "insert",
  "path": "thesis.tex",
  "content": "\\subsection{Additional Analysis}...",
  "position": "after:\\section{Results}"
}
```

**Position Options**:
- `line:42` - Insert at line 42
- `after:MARKER` - Insert after text marker
- `before:MARKER` - Insert before text marker

### 4. Project Templates

Create structured projects instantly:

```json
{
  "action": "create",
  "name": "my-novel",
  "template": "novel"
}
```

**Available Templates**:
- **book**: Multi-chapter book structure
- **thesis**: Academic thesis with proper formatting
- **math-heavy**: Mathematical document with theorem environments
- **novel**: Fiction writing with chapter formatting
- **article**: Standard article format
- **report**: Technical report structure

### 5. LaTeX Compilation

Compile documents with different engines:

```json
{
  "name": "compile",
  "arguments": {
    "path": "main.tex",
    "engine": "xelatex",
    "passes": 3
  }
}
```

**Engines**:
- `pdflatex`: Standard LaTeX (fast, basic)
- `xelatex`: Unicode support (for multiple languages, special fonts)
- `lualatex`: Advanced features (complex programming, modern fonts)

### 6. Enhanced File Support

Now supports additional file types:
- **Images**: PNG, JPG, JPEG, EPS, SVG, TIFF, BMP
- **Data**: CSV, DAT, JSON, XML (for scientific plots)
- **LaTeX Auxiliary**: AUX, LOG, TOC, LOF, LOT, IDX, IND, BBL, BLG

## Usage Examples

### Writing a Novel Chapter by Chapter

```python
# Create novel project
{
  "name": "project",
  "arguments": {
    "action": "create",
    "name": "my-epic-fantasy",
    "template": "novel"
  }
}

# Write chapter 1
{
  "name": "document",
  "arguments": {
    "action": "create",
    "path": "chapters/chapter01.tex",
    "content": "\\chapter{The Beginning}\n\nIt was a dark and stormy night..."
  }
}

# Continue writing (append mode)
{
  "name": "document", 
  "arguments": {
    "action": "append",
    "path": "chapters/chapter01.tex",
    "content": "\n\nThe protagonist entered the tavern, seeking shelter from the rain..."
  }
}
```

### Complex Mathematical Document

```python
# Create math-heavy project
{
  "name": "project",
  "arguments": {
    "action": "create",
    "name": "topology-research",
    "template": "math-heavy"
  }
}

# Add a theorem
{
  "name": "document",
  "arguments": {
    "action": "append",
    "path": "main.tex",
    "content": """
\\begin{theorem}[Fundamental Theorem of Topology]
Let $X$ be a compact Hausdorff space and $Y$ be a Hausdorff space. 
Then any continuous bijection $f: X \\to Y$ is a homeomorphism.
\\end{theorem}

\\begin{proof}
We need to show that $f^{-1}$ is continuous. Let $C \\subseteq X$ be closed.
Since $X$ is compact and $C$ is closed in $X$, we have that $C$ is compact.
By continuity of $f$, we get $f(C)$ is compact in $Y$.
Since $Y$ is Hausdorff, compact subsets are closed, so $f(C)$ is closed in $Y$.
This shows $(f^{-1})^{-1}(C) = f(C)$ is closed, proving $f^{-1}$ is continuous.
\\end{proof}
"""
  }
}
```

### Building a Thesis

```python
# Create thesis structure
{
  "name": "project",
  "arguments": {
    "action": "create",
    "name": "phd-thesis",
    "template": "thesis"
  }
}

# Work on methodology chapter
{
  "name": "document",
  "arguments": {
    "action": "edit",
    "path": "chapters/methodology.tex",
    "content": "\\chapter{Methodology}\n\n\\section{Research Design}\n..."
  }
}

# Insert a new section
{
  "name": "document",
  "arguments": {
    "action": "insert",
    "path": "chapters/methodology.tex",
    "position": "after:\\section{Research Design}",
    "content": "\n\\section{Data Collection}\n\\subsection{Survey Design}\n..."
  }
}

# Compile with bibliography
{
  "name": "compile",
  "arguments": {
    "path": "main.tex",
    "engine": "xelatex",
    "passes": 3
  }
}
```

## Best Practices for Long Documents

### 1. Use Incremental Writing
- Use `append` action for continuous writing sessions
- Avoids re-uploading entire documents
- Preserves your writing flow

### 2. Organize with Chapters
- Keep chapters in separate files
- Use `\\input{chapters/chapterN}` in main file
- Easier to manage and navigate

### 3. Regular Compilation
- Compile frequently to catch errors early
- Use appropriate engine for your needs
- Multiple passes for bibliographies and cross-references

### 4. Version Control Friendly
- Small, incremental changes work well with git
- Separate files for chapters facilitate collaboration
- Clear project structure

### 5. Memory Efficient
- 100MB limit accommodates most documents while keeping operations fast
- Auxiliary files are preserved for faster compilation
- Smart caching of compiled outputs

## Mathematical Writing Features

### Theorem Environments
Pre-configured environments:
- theorem, lemma, proposition, corollary
- definition, example
- remark, note

### Common Math Commands
Shortcuts included:
- `\R`, `\N`, `\Z`, `\Q`, `\C` for number sets
- `\argmax`, `\argmin` operators
- Physics package for derivatives and vectors

### Advanced Math Support
- TikZ for diagrams
- PGFPlots for data visualization
- Full AMSmath suite

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Streaming Support**: Large files are handled efficiently
2. **Incremental Updates**: Only changed content is processed
3. **Smart Caching**: Compiled PDFs are cached
4. **Parallel Processing**: Multiple chapters can be processed simultaneously

## Error Handling

The compile tool provides detailed error messages:
- Line numbers for LaTeX errors
- Missing package notifications
- Bibliography issues
- Cross-reference problems

## Conclusion

TeXFlow is now optimized for professional long-form LaTeX content creation, supporting everything from novels to complex mathematical treatises. The incremental writing features and large file support make it ideal for extensive projects that grow over time.
