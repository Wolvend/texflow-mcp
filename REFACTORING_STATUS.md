# TeXFlow Refactoring Status

## Completed ‚úÖ
1. Created `src/core/conversion_service.py` - Centralized conversion logic
2. Created `src/core/validation_service.py` - Centralized validation logic  
3. Enhanced `src/core/format_detector.py` - Added path detection methods
4. Started refactoring `document_operation.py` - Partially updated to use services

## In Progress üîÑ
1. Completing `document_operation.py` refactoring
   - ‚úÖ Updated format detection methods to use core service
   - ‚ùå Need to update _convert_document method
   - ‚ùå Need to update _validate_document method

## Pending ‚è≥
1. Refactor `output_operation.py` to use core services
2. Create semantic wrappers for:
   - printer
   - discover  
   - workflow
   - templates
3. Update `texflow.py` to use core services
4. Test all paths

## Key Issues Found
1. **Whitespace sensitivity** in multi-line string replacements
2. **Import paths** need adjustment for core services
3. **Parameter mapping** between MCP interface and internal methods

## Next Steps
1. Manually complete document_operation.py refactoring
2. Update output_operation.py similarly
3. Create new semantic operation classes for the 4 direct-call tools
4. Update texflow.py to use services
5. Comprehensive testing

## Benefits So Far
- Single implementation for each capability
- Clear separation between core logic and semantic enhancements
- Easier to maintain and fix bugs (like the pandoc -s flag issue)
